# Real-Time Waiting Queue Application Workflow

## Overview

The goal is to build a modern, scalable web application for managing a real-time waiting queue for a restaurant. The application will allow customers to join a queue, monitor their position in real-time, and notify them when itâ€™s their turn. This workflow is designed to ensure modularity, scalability, and adherence to best practices.

## Tech Stack

### Server-side:
- **Node.js**: Backend runtime.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for RESTful APIs.
- **GraphQL**: For flexible client-server communication.
- **WebSocket**: For real-time updates.
- **Redis**: Optional for managing real-time data and pub/sub for WebSocket events.
- **MongoDB**: Non-Relational database for structured data storage.

### Client-side:
- **Vite**: Build tool for efficient development.
- **React**: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- **shadcn**: UI component library for sleek and modern design.
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.

## Project Structure

### Server-Side Folder Structure

Organize the server project with separate directories for controllers, models, services, GraphQL schemas, and resolvers. Include configuration files for the database, environment variables, and middleware for validation, error handling, and logging.

### Client-Side Folder Structure

Organize the client project by separating reusable components, page-specific components, hooks, utilities, and global styles. Include configuration files for TailwindCSS and Vite.

## Workflow

### 0. Initial Setup

#### 0.1 Create a New Project
- Structure the project directory with a `server` and `client` folder.

### 1. Backend Setup

#### 1.1 Initialize the Project
- Create a new Node.js project and install required dependencies for Express, GraphQL, WebSocket, MongoDB, and Sequelize.
- Use tools like ESLint and Prettier for maintaining code quality.

#### 1.2 Configure the Database
- Set up a MongoDB database and establish a connection using Mongoose.
- Define models for the waiting queue, including attributes for customer details, status, and position in the queue.

#### 1.3 Setup GraphQL
- Create schemas for queries and mutations that support operations such as adding to the queue, updating status, and removing customers.
- Implement resolvers to handle the logic for each GraphQL operation.

#### 1.4 Integrate WebSocket for Real-Time Updates
- Configure WebSocket to handle real-time communication between the server and connected clients.
- Use Redis for pub/sub functionality if the application is deployed in a distributed environment.

#### 1.5 Modularize the Backend
- Separate concerns by organizing the project into directories for controllers, models, services, and middleware.
- Centralize configurations like database settings, WebSocket initialization, and environment variables.

### 2. Frontend Setup

#### 2.1 Initialize the Project
- Set up the project using Vite for React.
- Install and configure TailwindCSS for styling.
- Install libraries for GraphQL integration, such as Apollo Client.

#### 2.2 Build the User Interface
- Create reusable components for queue items, notifications, and forms.
- Design pages for joining the queue, monitoring queue status, and receiving notifications.
- Use `shadcn` components for modern, consistent design.

#### 2.3 Integrate GraphQL and WebSocket
- Configure Apollo Client to communicate with the backend GraphQL API.
- Establish WebSocket connections to receive real-time updates about queue changes.

---

### 3. Real-Time Integration

#### 3.1 GraphQL Integration
- Use a GraphQL client to perform operations like adding to the queue, updating status, and retrieving the current queue state.
- Ensure queries and mutations are efficiently designed to minimize latency.

#### 3.2 WebSocket Communication
- Set up WebSocket listeners on the frontend to receive updates when the queue changes.
- Handle events to dynamically update the UI with real-time information.

---

### 4. Final Steps

#### 4.1 Deployment
- Containerize the application using Docker for consistent deployment environments.
- The code will be supported on serverless platforms like AWS Lambda or Azure Functions for the backend.
